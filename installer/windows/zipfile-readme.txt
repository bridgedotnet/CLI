This is the bare zipfile package version of Bridge-CLI.

To run Bridge CLI from here, just unzip the package and run bridge.exe.

You can run bridge.exe from anywhere, and also add the directory it was
uncompressed to path, but the 'templates' and 'tools' subdirectories are
mandatory to be within the executable's directory.

To run Bridge CLI using mono, you have to prefix the mono command to
bridge.exe. Mono would enable using bridge on all platforms mono is supported
(OS X, Linux, or Windows itself).

mono bridge.exe <arguments>
